There are useful tools, such as the Internal Actions menu, that are only visible if internal mode is enabled in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Setting Internal Mode in the IDE Properties File
There are multiple ways to enable internal mode, but the simplest is within IntelliJ IDEA:
* Start IntelliJ IDEA.
* From the main menu, select **Help | Edit Custom Properties**.
This selection opens IntelliJ IDEA's `idea.properties` file.
If it does not exist, IntelliJ IDEA will prompt to create one.
* Add the line shown below to the `idea.properties` file:

```properties
idea.is.internal=true
```
* Save the `idea.properties` file and restart IntelliJ IDEA.

The Internal Actions menu is available in **Tools \| Internal Actions**.
