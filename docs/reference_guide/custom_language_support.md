*IntelliJ Platform* is a powerful platform for building development tools targeting *any* language.
Most of the IDE features consist of language-independent (provided by the platform) and language-specific parts.
Supporting a particular feature for a new language can be achieved with a small amount of effort:
a plugin must implement only the language-specific part.

This part of the documentation explains the main concepts of the *Language API* and guides you through the sequence of steps that are usually required to develop a custom language plugin.
You can obtain additional information about the *Language API* from the JavaDoc comments for the *Language API* classes and from the Properties language support source code, which is part of the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) source code.

If you prefer a full example to the detailed descriptions offered in this section, please check out a step-by-step tutorial on how to create custom language support for _Simple Language_:
[Custom Language Support Tutorial](/tutorials/custom_language_support_tutorial.md).
Corresponding steps from the tutorial are linked under the "Examples" section on each page of this reference.
