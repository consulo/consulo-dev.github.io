This page provides high-level overview of *External System* sub-system.
There are multiple project management systems ([Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/), [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) etc) and it's good to support them at the IDE.
Luckily, they all provide a similar set of facilities from the integration point of view:
* build IDE project from external system config (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle` etc);
* provide a list of available tasks;
* allow to execute a particular task;
* ...

That means that we can separate external system-specific logic and general IDE processing. *'External system'* sub-system provides simple API for wrapping external system and extensible IDE-specific processing logic.

## Project Management

### Project Data Domain

**General**
External system wrapper is required to be able to build project info on the basis of the given external system config.
That information is built using in terms of [`DataNode`](upsource:///platform/external-system-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/model/DataNode.java), [`Key`](upsource:///platform/external-system-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/model/Key.java) and [`ExternalEntityData`](upsource:///platform/external-system-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/model/project/ExternalEntityData.java).

![DataNode](/reference_guide/img/data-node.png)

Here *DataNode* class is just a holder for the target data (data type is defined by the *Key*).
Multiple DataNode objects might be organized in directed graph where every edge identifies parent-child relation.

For example, simple one-module project might look as below:

![DataNode Example](/reference_guide/img/data-node-example.png)


**Consequence**
The IDE provides a set of built-in *Key*s and *ExternalEntityData*s but any external system integration or third-party plugin developer might enhance project data by defining her own *Key* and *ExternalEntityData* and storing them at a child of appropriate *DataNode*.

### Managing Project Data

We need to process project data is built on external system config basis.
Here comes [`ProjectDataService`](upsource:///platform/external-system-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/service/project/manage/ProjectDataService.java).
It is a strategy which knows how to manage particular *ExternalEntityData*.
For example, when we want to import a project from external model, we can start by the top level *DataNode* which references project info and then import its data using corresponding service.

Custom services can be defined via *'externalProjectDataService'* extension.

The good thing is that we can separate project parsing and management here.
That means that a set of *DataNode*, *Key* and *ProjectDataServices* can be introduced for particular technology and then every external system integration can build corresponding data if necessary using it.

### Importing from External Model

IntelliJ platform provides standard API for that.
Namely, [`ProjectImportBuilder`](upsource:///java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/projectImport/ProjectImportBuilder.java) and [`ProjectImportProvider`](upsource:///java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/projectImport/ProjectImportProvider.java).
There are two classes built on *template method* pattern - [`AbstractExternalProjectImportBuilder`](upsource:///java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/service/project/wizard/AbstractExternalProjectImportBuilder.java) and [`AbstractExternalProjectImportProvider`](upsource:///java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/service/project/wizard/AbstractExternalProjectImportProvider.java).
Concrete implementations are registered in `plugin.xml`.

Here is an example from the gradle integration plugin:

    <projectImportProvider implementation="org.jetbrains.plugins.gradle.service.settings.GradleProjectImportProvider"/>
    <projectImportBuilder implementation="org.jetbrains.plugins.gradle.service.settings.GradleProjectImportBuilder"/>

Note that [`AbstractExternalProjectImportBuilder`](upsource:///java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/service/project/wizard/AbstractExternalProjectImportBuilder.java) is built on top of the 'external system settings' controls.

## Auto-Import

It's possible to configure external system integration to automatically refresh project structure when external project's config files are modified.

> **TIP** Since 2020.1, auto-import cannot be disabled by user.

### Auto-Import for `ExternalSystemManager` implementation

Describe project's settings files to track by having external system `ExternalSystemManager` implement [`ExternalSystemAutoImportAware`](upsource:///platform/external-system-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/ExternalSystemAutoImportAware.java).

> **NOTE** `ExternalSystemAutoImportAware.getAffectedExternalProjectPath()` is called quite often, that’s why it’s expected to return control as soon as possible.
> Helper `CachingExternalSystemAutoImportAware` class might be used for caching, i.e. `ExternalSystemManager` which implements `ExternalSystemAutoImportAware` can have a field like `new CachingExternalSystemAutoImportAware(new MyExternalSystemAutoImportAware())` and delegate `ExternalSystemAutoImportAware.getAffectedExternalProjectPath()` calls to it.

### Auto-Import for Standalone External Systems

Some external systems don’t have `ExternalSystemManager` (e.g., Maven), but they also can use auto-import core to track changes in settings files.
For this, implement `ExternalSystemProjectAware` interface that describes settings files for tracking and an action to reload project model.
Then register the instance with `ExternalSystemProjectTracker` to start tracking.

> **NOTE** Multiple `ExternalSystemProjectAware` instances can correspond to a single external system.
> It allows performing project reload differently depending on the set of settings files (project aware per settings file, per module, per external project, etc.).


### Icon for Reload Notification
Since 2020.1, the icon for reload notification can be specified per external system.
Implement `ExternalSystemIconProvider` and register via `com.intellij.externalIconProvider` extension point in `plugin.xml`.
Alternatively, set `reloadIcon` field external system implements `ExternalSystemIconProvider` directly.


## Settings

The general idea is that all external system settings controls are represented by implementations of [`ExternalSystemSettingsControl`](upsource:///platform/external-system-impl/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/util/ExternalSystemSettingsControl.java) interface.
There are also external system project-local settings and global external system settings.
So, basically particular external system settings UI looks as below:

![Configurable](/reference_guide/img/configurable.png)

It's recommended to extend from [`AbstractExternalProjectSettingsControl`](upsource:///platform/external-system-impl/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/service/settings/AbstractExternalProjectSettingsControl.java) for implementing project-level settings control as it already handles some of them.

Similar approach is used for providing 'import from external system' UI - implementation is expected to extend [`AbstractImportFromExternalSystemControl`](upsource:///java/idea-ui/src/com/intellij/openapi/externalSystem/service/settings/AbstractImportFromExternalSystemControl.java) and it has not linked external projects list but target external project path control:
