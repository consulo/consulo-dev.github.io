A symbol is a semantic element in some model, e.g., language model or framework model. 
The IntelliJ Platform uses [`Symbol`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/model/Symbol.java) to represent symbols, 
and `Symbol` serves as a link between Platform APIs, such as navigation, finding usages, or renaming. 
The platform obtains the target symbol from a [declaration](declarations_and_references.md#declarations) 
or by resolving a [reference](declarations_and_references.md#references), and then uses it to perform an action.
The `PsiElement` is considered as an element in the source tree (enhanced `ASTNode`). `Symbol` decouples semantic actions from PSI.

A `Symbol` is not required to be backed by a `PsiElement`, and it is incorrect to try to obtain the `PsiElement` from a `Symbol`.  
`Symbol` is not required to be bound to a `Project` as well, meaning the same instance might be shared between projects.

**Examples**:
- Java local variable is a symbol in Java language model, it's backed by a `PsiVariable` element;
- Compiled class is a symbol in JVM model, it's backed by JDK library stubs, and it's not bound to any project;
- Spring Bean is a symbol in Spring framework model, it's defined on-the-fly by framework support 
  (not backed by a `PsiElement`) and bound to a `Project`;
- Database column is a symbol defined by data source (not backed by a `PsiElement`)
and not bound to a `Project` since DB elements might be shared between projects.


## Lifecycle

The `Symbol` instance is expected to stay valid within a single read action, which means it's safe to pass the instance to different APIs.
A `Symbol` instance should not be referenced between read actions.
One should create a pointer via `Symbol.createPointer()`  in the current read action, and then call `Pointer.dereference()` to obtain a `Symbol` instance in the subsequent read action.
