A custom language plugin can provide its own items to be included in the lists shown when the user chooses the _Navigate | Class_ or _Navigate | Symbol_ action.
In order to do so, the plugin must provide implementations for the [`ChooseByNameContributor`](upsource:///platform/lang-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/ChooseByNameContributor.java) interface (separate implementations need to be provided for _Class_ and _Symbol_ respectively), and register them in the `com.intellij.gotoClassContributor` and `com.intellij.gotoSymbolContributor` extension points.

> **TIP** Please consider implementing [`ChooseByNameContributorEx`](upsource:///platform/lang-impl/src/com/intellij/navigation/ChooseByNameContributorEx.java) for better performance.

Each contributor needs to be able to return a complete list of names to show in the list for a specified project, which will then be filtered by the IDE according to the text typed by the user in the dialog.
Using [File-based or Stub indices](/basics/indexing_and_psi_stubs.md) to obtain matching candidates is highly recommended to improve performance.

For each name in that list, the contributor needs to provide a list of [`NavigationItem`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/NavigationItem.java) instances (typically [`PsiElement`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/psi/PsiElement.java)), which specify the destinations to jump to when a specific name is selected from the list.
