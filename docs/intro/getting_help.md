## Problems with the Guide

If you’re having problems with the guide itself, such as missing, incorrect, or confusing content, please [raise an issue on YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IJSDK&clearDraft=true&c=).
If the problem is easily solved, you can also submit a [Pull Request on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-sdk-docs).

If you just want to share feedback on the guide, again, [raise an issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IJSDK&clearDraft=true&c=), even if it’s for a discussion, ideas on improvements or suggestions.

> **NOTE** Please don't use the **IJSDK** YouTrack project for plugin or product support requests - it's intended for the SDK and the documentation, and you'll get a better response using one of the methods below.

## Problems with Code - Support Issues

For problems related to code, rather than the content of the guide, you have several options:

* [Plugin Development Forum](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/200366979-IntelliJ-IDEA-Open-API-and-Plugin-Development) - post a message to the support forum.
  It is regularly updated with answers by JetBrains team members.
* [#intellij-platform on JetBrains Platform Slack](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/slack/) - this chat room is a great place to ask questions, with answers coming from both JetBrains team members and members of the community

Of course, all issues will be used to try and improve this guide.

## Problems with Products

If you have a problem with an IntelliJ Platform-based product, such as IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, Rider, etc., please raise an issue on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com), assigning it to the correct project for the product.
