It's possible to run and debug a plugin directly from the *IntelliJ IDEA*.
You need a configured special profile (a *Plugin* Run/Debug configuration) that specifies the plugin module, VM parameters, and other specific options.
When you run such a profile, it launches the IDE with your plugin installed.

See [IDE Development Instances](/basics/ide_development_instance.md) for more information about configuration and advanced settings.

For information on how to change the Run/Debug configuration profile, refer to [Run/Debug Configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) and [Run/Debug Configuration: Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/run-debug-configuration-plugin.html) in *IntelliJ IDEA* Web Help.

Using *IntelliJ IDEA*'s debugger, you can find out the origin of the run-time errors and exceptions.
