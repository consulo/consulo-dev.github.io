_Listeners_ allow plugins to declaratively subscribe to events delivered through the message bus (see [Messaging infrastructure](/reference_guide/messaging_infrastructure.md) for details).

You can define both application- and project-level listeners.

Declarative registration of listeners allows you to achieve better performance than registering listeners from code. 
The advantage is because listener instances get created lazily - the first time an event is sent to the topic - and not during application startup or project opening.

## Defining Application-Level Listeners

To define an application-level listener, add the following section to your `plugin.xml`:

```xml
<applicationListeners>
  <listener class="myPlugin.MyListenerClass" topic="BaseListenerInterface"/>
</applicationListeners>
```

The `topic` attribute specifies the listener interface corresponding to the type of events you want to receive.
Usually, this is the interface used as the type parameter of the [`Topic`](upsource:///platform/extensions/src/com/intellij/util/messages/Topic.java) instance for the type of events.
The `class` attribute specifies the class in your plugin that implements the listener interface and receives the events.

As a specific example, if you want to receive events about all virtual file system changes, you need to implement the `BulkFileListener` interface, corresponding to the topic `VirtualFileManager.VFS_CHANGES`.
To subscribe to this topic from code, you could use something like the following snippet:

```java
messageBus.connect().subscribe(VirtualFileManager.VFS_CHANGES, new BulkFileListener() {
    @Override
    public void after(@NotNull List<? extends VFileEvent> events) {
        // handle the events
    }
});
```

To use declarative registration, you no longer need to reference the `Topic` instance.
Instead, you refer directly to the listener interface class:

```xml
<applicationListeners>
  <listener class="myPlugin.MyVfsListener"
            topic="com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.BulkFileListener"/>
</applicationListeners>
```

Then you provide the listener implementation as a top-level class:

```java
public class MyVfsListener implements BulkFileListener {
    @Override
    public void after(@NotNull List<? extends VFileEvent> events) {
        // handle the events
    }
}
```

## Defining Project-Level Listeners

Project-level listeners are registered in the same way, except that the top-level tag is `<projectListeners>`.
They can be used to listen to project-level events, for example, tool window operations:

```xml
<projectListeners>
    <listener class="MyToolwindowListener"
              topic="com.intellij.openapi.wm.ex.ToolWindowManagerListener" />
</projectListeners>
```

The class implementing the listener interface can define a one-argument constructor accepting a `Project`, and it will receive the instance of the project for which the listener is created:

```java
public class MyToolwindowListener implements ToolWindowManagerListener {
    private final Project project;

    public MyToolwindowListener(Project project) {
        this.project = project;
    }

    @Override
    public void stateChanged() {
        // handle the state change
    }
}
```

## Additional Attributes

Registration of listeners can be restricted using the following attributes:

- `os` - allows to restrict listener to given OS, e.g., `os="windows"` for Windows only (2020.1 and later)
- `activeInTestMode` - set to `false` to disable listener if `com.intellij.openapi.application.Application.isUnitTestMode()`==`true`
- `activeInHeadlessMode` - set to `false` to disable listener if `com.intellij.openapi.application.Application.isHeadlessEnvironment()`==`true`.
  Also, covers `activeInTestMode` as test mode implies headless mode.
