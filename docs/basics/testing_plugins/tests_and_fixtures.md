The *IntelliJ Platform* testing infrastructure is not tied to any specific test framework.
In fact, the IntelliJ IDEA Team uses JUnit, TestNG, and Cucumber for testing different parts of the project.
However, most of the tests are written using JUnit 3.

When writing your tests, you have the choice between using a standard base class to perform the test set up for you and using a fixture class, which lets you perform the setup manually and does not tie you to a specific test framework.

With the former approach, you can use classes such as [`LightPlatformCodeInsightFixtureTestCase`](upsource:///platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/fixtures/LightPlatformCodeInsightFixtureTestCase.java) (renamed to [`BasePlatformTestCase`](upsource:///platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/fixtures/BasePlatformTestCase.java) in 2019.2).

With the latter approach, you use the [`IdeaTestFixtureFactory`](upsource:///platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/fixtures/IdeaTestFixtureFactory.java) class to create instances of fixtures for the test environment, and you need to call the fixture creation and setup methods from the test setup method used by your test framework.
