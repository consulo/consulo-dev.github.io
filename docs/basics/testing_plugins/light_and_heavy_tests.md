Plugin tests run in a real, rather than mocked, *IntelliJ Platform* environment and use real implementations for most application and project components/services.

Loading and initializing all the project components and services for a project to run tests is a relatively expensive operation, and we want to avoid doing it for each test.
Dependently on the loading and execution time, we make a difference between *heavy* tests and *light* tests available in *IntelliJ Platform* test framework:

* *Heavy* tests create a new project for each test.
* *Light* tests reuse a project from the previous test run when possible.

Light and heavy tests use different base classes or fixture classes, as described below.

> **NOTE** Because of the performance difference, we recommend plugin developers to write *light* tests whenever possible.

## Light Tests

The standard way of writing a light test is to extend the following classes:

* [`LightPlatformCodeInsightFixtureTestCase`](upsource:///platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/fixtures/LightPlatformCodeInsightFixtureTestCase.java) for tests that don't have any Java dependencies.
* [`LightCodeInsightFixtureTestCase`](upsource:///java/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/fixtures/LightCodeInsightFixtureTestCase.java) for tests that require the Java PSI or any related functionality.

> **NOTE** In 2019.2, `LightPlatformCodeInsightFixtureTestCase` has been renamed to `BasePlatformTestCase` and `LightCodeInsightFixtureTestCase` to `LightJavaCodeInsightFixtureTestCase` respectively.

When writing a light test, you can specify the project's requirements that you need to have in your test, such as the module type, the configured SDK, facets, libraries, etc.
You do so by extending the [`LightProjectDescriptor`](upsource:///platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/LightProjectDescriptor.java) class and returning your project descriptor from `getProjectDescriptor()`.
Before executing each test, the project will be reused if the test case returns the same project descriptor (usually stored in static final field) as the previous one, or recreated if the descriptor is different (`equals() = false`).


## Heavy Tests

> **NOTE** If you need to set up a multi-module project for your tests, you **must** write a heavy test.

> **NOTE** In 2019.3, `PlatformTestCase` has been renamed to `HeavyPlatformTestCase` reflecting its "heavy test" characteristics.

The setup code for a multi-module Java project looks something like that:

```java
final TestFixtureBuilder<IdeaProjectTestFixture> projectBuilder = IdeaTestFixtureFactory.getFixtureFactory().createFixtureBuilder(getName());

// Repeat the following line for each module
final JavaModuleFixtureBuilder moduleFixtureBuilder = projectBuilder.addModule(JavaModuleFixtureBuilder.class);

myFixture = JavaTestFixtureFactory.getFixtureFactory().createCodeInsightFixture(projectBuilder.getFixture());
```
