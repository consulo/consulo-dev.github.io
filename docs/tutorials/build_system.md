The [gradle-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin) Gradle plugin is the recommended solution for building IntelliJ plugins.
The plugin takes care of the dependencies of your plugin project - both the base IDE and other plugin dependencies.

> **TIP** [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template) makes it easier to create and maintain your IDE plugins, having the Gradle plugin already integrated and CI covered with GitHub Actions.

> **NOTE** If a new plugin will be Scala-based, a dedicated SBT plugin [sbt-idea-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/sbt-idea-plugin) is available.

The gradle-intellij-plugin provides tasks to run the IDE with your plugin and to publish your plugin to the [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com).
To make sure that your plugin is not affected by [API changes](/reference_guide/api_changes_list.md), which may happen between major releases of the platform, you can quickly build your plugin against many versions of the base IDE.

> **WARNING** When adding additional repositories to your Gradle build script, always use HTTPS protocol.

> **NOTE** Please make sure to always upgrade to the latest version of `gradle-intellij-plugin`.
Follow releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin/releases).
