This page discusses the steps to configure a plugin project for creating tests.

## 1.1. Create a Folder for Tests
Open the plugin project and create a separate folder named `test` under the `src` directory.
Under `test`, create the `java` folder for test source code, and the folder `testData` for test data files and reimport the Gradle project.

```text
└── src
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   └── resources
    └── test
        ├── java
        └── testData
```

## 1.2. Set the Run Configuration Parameters
Because some of the tests use Java files as test data, the tests need to mock up the project SDK.
IntelliJ IDEA does everything automatically when the utility class [`LightJavaCodeInsightFixtureTestCase`](upsource:///java/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/fixtures/LightJavaCodeInsightFixtureTestCase.java) is used as the basis for the tests.

The system properties are defined in the `build.gradle` file using the snippet shown below.
The `/path/to/community/` is set to the absolute path to the local intellij-community source's root directory on the machine running the tests.
For example, on macOS the `path/to/community/` might be `/Users/<user name>/Documents/<IJ community source root>/`

```groovy
  test {
    systemProperty "idea.home.path", "/path/to/community/"
  }
```
